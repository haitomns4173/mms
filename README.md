# Pharmear 

PHARMEAR an open-source software for Pharmacy Store

PHARMEAR is open source, free to use, it offers a modern UI, with less clutter, easy to learn, easy to use, makes bills fast, shows you the status of your store, has intellisense to make bills with ease, user management and a lot more.

PHARMEAR is made using JAVA in Apache NetBeans, uses MySQL Server as the database, and libraries like jFreeChart, jCommon, and MySQL Connector/J for Bar Graphs and connection to the database. Git has been used for version control. Icons8, coolors.co are used for UI. We have implemented intellisense/autosuggestion in the program that helps users while bill making and managing stocks.

The theme of the project revolves around Medication. PHARMEAR is a simple program to use that can be used in a very low-end machine. It has very less to learn for users and much to offer them. We have just given the users what they want like Bill Making, Medicine Management, User Permission Control. We have a pre-made database of 4000+ medicines to help users while inserting medicine to the store. It also has a Pharmacy Status corner to tell users about their store.
